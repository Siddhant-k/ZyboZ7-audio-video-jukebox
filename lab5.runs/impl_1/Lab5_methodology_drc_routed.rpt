2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.655 ns between state_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out2_pxl_clk_gen) and hdmi_controller/DataEncoders[1].DataEncoder/pDataOut_1_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_pxl_clk_gen). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.709 ns between state_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out2_pxl_clk_gen) and hdmi_controller/DataEncoders[2].DataEncoder/pDataOut_1_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_pxl_clk_gen). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch blue_data_reg[0]/L7 (in blue_data_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin blue_data_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
